# Hand of cards redux exercise

The app starts with a store that contains 52 cards.

The components are already connected for you, it's your job to set up:

- draw cards from deck one at a time, to a maximum of 5 (if there are cards left in the deck)
- discard cards to the discard pile
- reshuffle the discard into the deck
